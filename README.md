Welcome to the BASE helm chart.
This is basiclly helm chart gone rouge - and somehow I did find lots of fun in go templating and made this skeleton for doing everything with only one base chart template.

The idea with this chart is to make it possible to a software developer to deploy anything, and setup all kind of software with a single values.yaml. Is it full stack or just a simple app is possible to deploy it with a single values file.

This is of cause under constant development, so feel free to make pull requests.

First and formost, it may be a good idea to lookup the examples in the example folder to get started.
in the below section will I describe the variables and how to use them, but often we need to get some experience with a tool before we can understand any of the settings and configurations.
